* In 2017, I was asked to join the editorial board of the journal for ["Computing and Software for Big Science"](https://www.springer.com/physics/particle+and+nuclear+physics/journal/41781?countryChanged=true) published by Springer.
* In 2018, I was asked to be Co-Editor of the [American Physics Society (APS) Division of Particles and Fields (DPF)](https://www.aps.org/units/dpf/) white paper as input to the [European Particle Physics Strategy Update 2018 – 2020](http://europeanstrategyupdate.web.cern.ch), responsible for the computing section.
* Organizer of the Computing & Machine Learning parallel session at [The CPAD Instrumentation Frontier Workshop 2018](http://www.brown.edu/Conference/CPAD2018/) “New Technologies for Discovery IV”.
* In 2020, I was asked to co-chair the [Computational Frontier](https://snowmass-wiki.fnal.gov/wiki/Computational_Frontier) in the [Snowmass 2021 process](https://snowmass-wiki.fnal.gov/wiki/Main_Page). Because the Snowmass process was delayed by a year, I needed to resign in 2020 due to other high priority committments. I oversaw the process till a successor was appointed.
* Activities in public outreach:
	* Regular participation in Fermilab’s [Ask-A-Scientist](https://ed.fnal.gov/programs/tours/ask-a-scientist.shtml) program as lecturer and answering questions of the general public.
	* Tour guide for Fermilab’s [Saturday Morning Physics](http://saturdaymorningphysics.fnal.gov) program, especially of the computing facilities.
	* Regular question-and-answer sessions for high school classes visiting Fermilab.
* Active in mentorship programs
	* Since January 2020, I am mentoring a postdoc in the Fermilab Neutrino Division in the context of the inter-divisonal mentoring program of Fermilab.
	* Since April 2022, I am mentoring a postdoc from UCSD in the context of the U.S. CMS collaboration mentoring program. The postdoc has been apppointed a faculty position at UFL in 2023 and I continue to mentor them.
