* Particle physicist conducting **leading edge research** for New Physics Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics
    * Multiple years of experience in analyzing high-energy collisions using a multitude of different techniques. One of my most noticeable publications is the [**Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021).
* **Leader in scientific computing**
    * Expert in object oriented software development, statistical data analysis methods and Monte Carlo simulation techniques as well as various optimization and machine learning techniques.
    * Deep experience in planning, developing, and operating distributed computing infrastructures that provide access to several hundred-thousand computing cores and hundreds of petabytes of disk space.
    * Intimately familiar with scientific grid sites, academic and commercial clouds and U.S. supercomputers.
    * Part of a worldwide community planning process for the software and computing infrastructure of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC, 2016). Contributed to the [overview white paper of the community](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982) and editor of the topical white paper about the future of [data analysis in High Energy Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03983).
    * Interested in using idustry technologies for petabyte scale analysis [(CMS Big Data Project)](https://cms-big-data.github.io/).
* **U.S.CMS Software and Computing Operations Deputy Program manager** enabling analysis of LHC particle collisions in the U.S. for the 2500 physicist strong CMS collaboration.
