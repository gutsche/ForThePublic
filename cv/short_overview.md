I am a **leader in scientific computing** with over 15 years of experience and have acquired deep knowledge in scientific software and computing infrastructure. I am a particle physicist at heart and conducted and enabled breakthrough scientific discoveries in High Energy Physics (HEP). My goal is to continously expand my horizon and use my expertise to enable a growing set of science disciplines through software and computing.

I am intimately familiar with scientific grid sites, academic and commercial clouds and the largest U.S. supercomputers. I am also an expert in object-oriented software development, statistical data analysis methods and Monte Carlo simulation techniques as well as various optimization and machine learning techniques.

Since August 2024, I am the Deputy Associate Lab Director (interim) for the Computational Science and AI Directorate (CSAID) at the Department of Energy (DOE) Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). I oversee strategic and tactical initiatives to support the scientific program at Fermilab with software and computing solutions.

From March 2019 to December 2024, I was appointed U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager overseeing the U.S. CMS Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities as well as software maintenance and development efforts for core software, computing infrastructure software and analysis systems. To plan the R&D needed for HL-LHC, I co-authored a [strategic plan outlining four grand challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00772). For Fermilab, I created the Computing Resources Evolution STrategy (CREST) process. The goal is to document a strategy for the evolution of Fermilab's computing resources in the light of current experiment needs and future anticipated needs of DUNE and HL-LHC with a planning horizon of 10 years.

I am part of a worldwide community process to prepare the software and computing infrastructure for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC, 2029), which will require many times the computing resources as today. In 2020 I was asked to co-lead the [Computational Frontier](https://snowmass21.org/computational/start) of the [Particle Physics Snowmass 2021 process](https://snowmass21.org), the particle physics community planning exercise to document a scientific vision for the future of particle physics in the U.S. and its international partners.

My original motivation came from conducting **leading edge research** for New Physics Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics as well as precision Standard Model measurements. I have multiple years of experience in analyzing high-energy collisions at different particle colliders using a multitude of different techniques. In my studies at the LHC, I have lead searches for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model using top quarks, and contributed to searches for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter. One of my most noticeable publications is the [Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021).
