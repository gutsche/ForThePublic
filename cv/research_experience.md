## Research Experience

### CMS collaboration: 2005 – Present

I joined the CMS collaboration when I started my Research Associate position at Fermilab in 2005. My research focus has been the search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC. Searching for new physics at the energy frontier requires a clear signature to understand Standard Model backgrounds.
 
I was a founding member of an analysis group with members from Fermilab/UCSD/UCSB, focusing on final states with leptons. The approach proved to be successful; I was involved in early publications of the CMS experiment such as a measurement of the top quark cross section. With more data available, the focus shifted to new physics and beyond the Standard Model processes. We were leaders of the WW to dilepton analysis in the CMS Higgs discovery paper [7] and searches for SUSY in same-sign and opposite-sign dilepton as well as single lepton channels.

I have been supervising several Fermilab postdoctoral researchers. Together with Jacob Linacre, I first concentrated on exploiting the dilepton signature to search for pair production of a heavy top-like quark (t’) using the complete 2011 dataset [6]. I continued studying the properties of top quarks exploiting angular distributions of the dilepton final state. At the Tevatron, top pair forward-backward asymmetry measurements showed deviations from the Standard Model. We were the first to use the dilepton final state to measure the top pair charge asymmetry at the LHC to further investigate the deviations seen at the Tevatron. We published papers for the 7 and 8 TeV datasets of LHC Run 1 for top pair spin correlations and top quark polarization [2,4] as well as the top pair charge asymmetry [1,3]. In the process of our work, my Postdoc Jacob Linacre was appointed the CMS Top Properties Subgroup Convener in the CMS Physics organization and started in January 2014 his two-year tenure.

Currently, I am working with Matteo Cremonesi in a team from Fermilab/MIT/Northwestern/Bari on dark matter searches in the fully hadronic monoTop channel. 

### ZEUS collaboration: 2001 – 2005

I started my graduate research at the University of Hamburg in 2001 joining the ZEUS collaboration during the upgrade of the machine and the integration of the new micro-vertex silicon strip detector. Because of its precise tracking capabilities, I planned to use secondary vertex and impact parameter techniques to identify beauty quarks decaying into muons.

I first concentrated on the identification of muons. In a team of graduate students, I improved the ZEUS muon reconstruction by exploiting redundancies of the different detector components from tracking, calorimetry, to the muon detectors. One of my larger contributions was the implementation of an advanced muon reconstruction efficiency calculation using reference muon signatures. I then used the complete pre-upgrade 1996-2000 dataset to extract beauty quark cross sections in photoproduction. I used the transverse momentum of the muon relative to a jet to identify beauty quarks and measured differential angular correlation cross sections which were found to be in agreement with NLO predictions. With the first data after the upgrade, the micro-vertex detector became available. I used the dataset from 2003-2004 to identify beauty quarks using impact parameter techniques for the first time in ZEUS.
