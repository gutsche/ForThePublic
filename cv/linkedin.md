I am a leader in scientific computing with over 15 years of experience and have developed deep expertise in scientific software and computing infrastructure. At heart, I am a particle physicist and have both conducted and enabled breakthrough scientific discoveries in High Energy Physics (HEP). My goal is to continuously broaden my horizons and leverage my expertise to support an expanding range of scientific disciplines through software and computing [0].

I am intimately familiar with scientific grid sites, academic and commercial cloud platforms, and the largest supercomputers in the U.S. I am also an expert in object-oriented software development, statistical data analysis methods, Monte Carlo simulation techniques, and various optimization and machine learning approaches.

Since January 2026 I have served as the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for the Computational Science and AI Directorate (CSAID) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), a position that I held before on an interim basis since August 2024. I lead strategic and tactical initiatives to support Fermilab’s scientific program through software and computing solutions.

From March 2019 to December 2024, I served as the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program Manager, overseeing the U.S. CMS Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities, as well as software maintenance and development efforts for core software, computing infrastructure, and analysis systems. To guide R\&D planning for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), I co-authored a strategic plan outlining four grand challenges [1]. At Fermilab, I created the Computing Resources Evolution STrategy (CREST) process, which defines a ten-year strategy for the evolution of the lab’s computing resources based on current experimental needs and anticipated future requirements for DUNE and HL-LHC.

My original motivation came from conducting cutting-edge research in the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, as well as performing precision measurements within the Standard Model. I have many years of experience analyzing high-energy collisions at various particle colliders using a wide range of techniques. At the LHC, I have led searches for signs of physics beyond the Standard Model using top quarks and contributed to searches for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter. One of my most notable publications is the Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012 [4].
