Particle physics is based on particle detection by sophisticated experimental devices and their comparison to accurate simulations. High Energy Physics (HEP) requires very large amounts of computing resources to analyze simulations and data recorded by the detectors. I have deep knowledge of planning, developing, maintaining and operating distributed computing infrastructures providing access to several hundred-thousand computing cores and many hundred of petabytes of disk space. I am intimately familiar with scientific grid sites, academic and commercial clouds and the largest supercomputers at High Performance Computing centers in the U.S. and across the world. The infrastructure then execute scientific software consisting of millions of lines of C++ and python code that is needed to extract physics results. I am an expert in object oriented software development, statistical data analysis methods and Monte Carlo simulation techniques as well as various optimization and machine learning techniques.

These technical aspects of my work are closely connected to my physics research, as they enable the analysis of particle physics detector data and simulations as a basis to extract physics results. My active involvement in HEP science allows me to guide the science community to benefit from the latest computing developments, bridging the worlds of science and IT.
