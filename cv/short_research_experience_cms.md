* Joined the CMS collaboration in 2005. Research focus: search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC, especially for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter.
    * Founding member of an analysis group with members from Fermilab/UCSD/UCSB, focusing on final states with leptons.
    * Supervised several Fermilab postdoctoral researchers:
        * Jacob Linac measuring top quark properties and searching for heavy top-like particles.
        * Matteo Cremonesi searching for Dark Matter.
        * Nick Smith analyzing Higgs boson decay channels, starting with the decay into two bottom quarks.
