I started my graduate research at the University of Hamburg in 2001 joining the ZEUS collaboration during the upgrade of the HERA collider and the integration of the new ZEUS micro-vertex silicon strip detector. Because of its precise tracking capabilities, I planned to use secondary vertex and impact parameter techniques to identify beauty quarks decaying into muons.

I first concentrated on the identification of muons. In a team of graduate students, I improved the ZEUS muon reconstruction by exploiting redundancies of the different detector components from tracking, calorimetry, to the muon detectors. I then used the complete pre-upgrade 1996-2000 dataset to extract beauty quark cross sections in photo production. I used the transverse momentum of the muon relative to a jet to identify beauty quarks and measured differential angular correlation cross sections, which were found to be in agreement with NLO predictions. With the first data after the upgrade, the micro-vertex detector became available. I used the dataset from 2003-2004 to identify beauty quarks using impact parameter techniques for the first time in ZEUS. Both measurements were documented in [my thesis](https://doi.org/10.3204/DESY-THESIS-2005-010).
