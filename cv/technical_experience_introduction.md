# Technical Experience

I possess deep expertise in planning, developing, maintaining, and operating distributed computing infrastructures that provide access to several hundred thousand computing cores and hundreds of petabytes of disk storage. I am proficient in efficiently storing and retrieving data from permanent tape storage. I am intimately familiar with both High-Throughput Computing (HTC) and High-Performance Computing (HPC), including scientific grid sites, academic and commercial clouds, as well as the largest supercomputers at HPC centers in the U.S. and worldwide. This infrastructure supports scientific software composed of millions of lines of C++ and Python code, essential for extracting physics results. I am an expert in object-oriented software development, statistical data analysis methods, Monte Carlo simulation techniques, and various optimization and machine learning approaches.

The technical components of my work are tightly linked to scientific research, enabling the analysis of particle physics detector data and simulations as the foundation for producing physics results. My active engagement in High Energy Physics (HEP) research allows me to guide the scientific community in leveraging the latest computing innovations, effectively bridging the domains of science and scientific computing.

My current R\&D projects include:

* Revolutionizing wide-area network utilization by managing data transfers through dynamic Software-Defined Networking (SDN) channels within the DOE ASCRâ€™s [ESnet SENSE/Rucio](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/contributions/11306/) project.
* Characterizing and distinguishing traffic flow types at site borders using AI-based packet header analysis in collaboration with ESnet AI researchers.
* Enabling CMS to harness the latest GPU-based DOE leadership-class supercomputers.
* Transforming the end-user analysis paradigm by integrating industry-standard Python analysis ecosystems and adopting columnar analysis techniques.
