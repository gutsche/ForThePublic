# Leadership Experience

Leveraging my extensive expertise in scientific software and computing infrastructure, I contribute to global community efforts to shape the future of software and computing for science, with a particular focus on the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). My leadership centers on providing the strategic vision needed to enable groundbreaking scientific discoveries.

For HL-LHC, I co-authored a strategic plan for the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program ([arXiv:2312.00772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00772)) that outlines four grand challenges that must be addressed:

1. Modernizing Physics Software and Improving Algorithms
2. Building Infrastructure for Exabyte-Scale Datasets
3. Transforming the Scientific Data Analysis Process
4. Transitioning from R\&D to Operations

To implement this plan, I established a [Research Initiative](https://uscms-software-and-computing.github.io/postdocs) within the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program. This initiative provides partial funding for postdoctoral researchers to explore novel and forward-looking solutions to these four grand challenges. The strategic plan also builds on prior contributions to broader community planning exercises, such as the [Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R\&D for the 2020s](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982).

In 2024, I was appointed co-lead of the CMS Collaboration Board Sub-Group for Offline & Computing for HL-LHC. I proposed the creation of this sub-group to introduce structured coordination and effort planning within the Offline & Computing area—an innovation for CMS, where such formal coordination had previously only existed in detector projects through institutional boards.

At Fermilab, I created the Computing Resources Evolution STrategy (CREST) process, which defines a ten-year strategic plan for evolving the lab’s computing resources. This plan considers both current experimental needs and anticipated demands from DUNE and HL-LHC.

As part of the Department of Energy's [Center for Computational Excellence (HEP-CCE)](https://www.anl.gov/hep-cce/activities), I co-authored a proposal in 2020 to lead four sub-projects addressing key challenges in adapting HEP computing for heterogeneous architectures:

1. **Parallel Portability Solutions (PPS):** Develop algorithms that can be written once and compiled for CPUs and accelerators alike.
2. **Fine-Grained I/O and Storage (IOS):** Optimize data structures and access patterns for large shared storage systems on HPC platforms.
3. **Event Generators (EG):** Adapt HEP theory code for efficient execution on HPC systems.
4. **Complex Workflows (CW):** Enable orchestration of multi-step workflows across heterogeneous hardware.

I was appointed technical lead of the PPS sub-project, which has since completed its funding cycle.

I am nationally and internationally recognized for my leadership. I was selected to co-lead the [Computational Frontier](https://snowmass21.org/computational/start) for the [Snowmass 2021 process](https://snowmass21.org), the U.S. particle physics community planning exercise. I also serve on the editorial boards of the journal ["Computing and Software for Big Science"](https://www.springer.com/physics/particle+and+nuclear+physics/journal/41781?countryChanged=true) and the [European Physical Journal (EPJ C)](https://epjc.epj.org/epjc-editorial-board).
