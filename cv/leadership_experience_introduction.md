# Leadership Experience

I am employing my extensive knowledge of scientific software and computing infrastructure in contributing to the worldwide community efforts to plan for the software and computing for the future of science, with emphasis on the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The goal is to provide the means to enable scientific discoveries that are groundbreaking through strategic leadership and vision.

For HL-LHC, I co-authored a strategic plan for the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program outlining four grand challenges: Modernizing Physics Software and Improving Algorithms; Building Infrastructure for Exabyte-Scale Datasets; Transforming the Scientific Data Analysis Process; and Transition from R\&D to Operations ([arXiv:2312.00772](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00772)). This included previous contributions to a variety of community planning exercises like the [Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982). I am the CMS Collaboration Board co-lead of the Sub-Committee for Offline & Computing for HL-LHC. This sub-committee is a novelty for the CMS collaboration and is my approach to introduce coordination and planning of Offline & Computing effort into the CMS collaboration that didn't exist before. To realize the strategic plan, I created an [Research Initiative](https://uscms-software-and-computing.github.io/postdocs) in the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations program to provide partial funding for postdoctoral researches to investigate novel and forward-looking software and computing solutions for the 4 grand challenges of HL-LHC.

For Fermilab, I created the Computing Resources Evolution STrategy (CREST) process. The goal is to document a strategy for the evolution of Fermilab's computing resources in the light of current experiment needs and future anticipated needs of DUNE and HL-LHC with a planning horizon of 10 years.

For the DOE [Center for Computational Excellence (HEP-CCE)](https://www.anl.gov/hep-cce/activities) I co-wrote the proposal to execute 4 sub-projects to (1) investigate parallel portability solutions (PPS) to develop algorithmic code once and compile it transparently for the various CPU and accelerator-based architectures; (2) Fine-Grained I/O and Storage (IOS) to optimize data structures on disk and in memory and optimize data access on large shared storage systems at HPC systems; (3) Event Generators (EG) to optimize HEP theory code for execution on HPC systems; (4) Complex Workflows (CW) to orchestrate workflows whose steps need different hardware platforms. I was appointed technical lead of the PPS sub-project.

I am recognized nationally and internationally through membership of various committees, being selected to co-lead the [Computational Frontier](https://snowmass21.org/computational/start) of the [Snowmass 2021 process](https://snowmass21.org), and asked to be a member of the editorial board of the journal for ["Computing and Software for Big Science"](https://www.springer.com/physics/particle+and+nuclear+physics/journal/41781?countryChanged=true).
