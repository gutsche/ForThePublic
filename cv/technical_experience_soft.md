In the U.S. CMS Software and Computing project, I am curently responsible for the Software and Support area. Under my guidance, the CMS software framework CMSSW is developed, as well as critical R&D is conducted in the areas of vectorized tracking software, machine learning and novel analysis facilities.

Since 2005 and before the start of the LHC data taking in 2010, I was deeply involved in getting the CMS software ready for data taking. I was the lead developer of an innovative tracking algorithm that was used during the commissioning of the CMS detector called RoadSearch. I conducted the first software tutorials in CMS, teaching the CMS community the basics of analysis software and how to perform analysis on the GRID, using a user-friendly GRID analysis tool called CRAB, of which I was one of the lead developers.

During my graduate student time at DESY from 2001 to 2005, I was one of the proponents and lead developers of a new object-oriented and ROOT-based event display. The upgrade of the ZEUS detector made it necessary to integrate the new and changed detector components in the event visualization solution of ZEUS. A client-server structure allowed physicists to display events without direct access to the event store. Online events could also be displayed worldwide with very small latency during data taking.
