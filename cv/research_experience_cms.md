I joined the CMS collaboration at the LHC in 2005 and my research focus has been the search for New Physics Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics as well as precision Standard Model measurements.

I was a founding member of an analysis group with members from Fermilab/UCSD/UCSB, focusing on final states with leptons. The approach proved to be successful; after early publications such as a measurement of the [top quark cross section](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP07(2011)049), the focus shifted to new physics and beyond the Standard Model processes. We were leaders of the WW to dilepton analysis in the [CMS Higgs discovery paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021), and searches for SUSY in same-sign and opposite-sign dilepton as well as single lepton channels. The group is currently continuing the searches for SUSY in lepton final states as well as Standard Model processes.

I have been supervising several Fermilab postdoctoral researchers helping me to pursue my research interests.

* Together with Jacob Linacre, I concentrated on exploiting the dilepton signature to search for [pair production of a heavy top-like quark (tâ€™)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.07.059). I continued studying the properties of top quarks exploiting angular distributions of the dilepton final state. We were the first to use the dilepton final state to measure the top pair charge asymmetry at the LHC to further investigate the deviations seen at the Tevatron. We published LHC Run 1 papers for top pair spin correlations and top quark polarization for the [7 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.182001) and [8 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.052007) datasets as well as the top pair charge asymmetry for the [7 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP04(2014)191) and [8 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.006) datasets.
* From 2015 to 2021, I supervised Fermilab PostDoc Matteo Cremonesi. He created a new dark matter analysis effort at the Fermilab LHC Physics Center (LPC), searching for dark matter particles in various channels. The first publication presented the [search for dark matter in events with energetic, hadronically decaying top quarks and missing transverse momentum](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP06(2018)027) in the 13 TeV 2016 dataset of LHC Run 2. The second publication describes the [search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06562) in the same dataset. The group then concentrated on other mono-object channels with an expanding effort at the LPC.
* Since 2018, I am supervising Fermilab PostDoc Nick Smith. He joined the Higgs efforts of the LPC and is contributing to the analysis of the Higgs decay channel into two bottom quarks, and two charm quarks.
