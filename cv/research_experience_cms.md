I joined the CMS collaboration at the LHC in 2005, focusing my research on searching for New Physics Beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics, as well as performing precision Standard Model measurements.

I was a founding member of an analysis group composed of researchers from Fermilab, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Barbara, concentrating on final states involving leptons. This approach proved successful: following early publications such as a measurement of the [top quark cross section](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP07%282011%29049), the group shifted its focus toward new physics and beyond Standard Model processes. We led the WW to dilepton analysis in the [CMS Higgs discovery paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021) and conducted searches for Supersymmetry (SUSY) in same-sign and opposite-sign dilepton channels, as well as single lepton channels. The group continues its efforts in SUSY searches in lepton final states and Standard Model measurements.

I have supervised several Fermilab postdoctoral researchers in pursuit of these research goals:

* Together with Jacob Linacre, I focused on exploiting the dilepton signature to search for the [pair production of a heavy top-like quark (t’)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.07.059). We continued investigating top quark properties through angular distributions in the dilepton final state. Notably, we were the first to measure the top pair charge asymmetry at the LHC using the dilepton final state to further explore deviations previously observed at the Tevatron. Our work includes LHC Run 1 publications on top pair spin correlations and top quark polarization for the [7 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.182001) and [8 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.052007) datasets, as well as top pair charge asymmetry measurements for the [7 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP04%282014%29191) and [8 TeV](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.006) datasets.

* From 2015 to 2021, I supervised Fermilab Postdoc Matteo Cremonesi, who established a new dark matter analysis effort at the Fermilab LHC Physics Center (LPC). This work involved searching for dark matter particles in various channels. The first publication presented the [search for dark matter in events with energetic, hadronically decaying top quarks and missing transverse momentum](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP06%282018%29027) using the 13 TeV 2016 dataset from LHC Run 2. The second focused on the [search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06562) in the same dataset. Subsequently, the group expanded to other mono-object channels at the LPC.

* From 2018 to 2024, I supervised Fermilab Postdoc Nick Smith, who joined the LPC’s Higgs physics efforts. He contributed to the analysis of Higgs decay channels into two bottom quarks and two charm quarks and is currently focusing on effective field theory (EFT)-based analyses.
