## Computational Science and AI Directorate (CSAID)

Since January 2026 I have served as the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for the Computational Science and AI Directorate (CSAID) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), a position that I held before on an interim basis since August 2024. I lead strategic and tactical initiatives to support Fermilab’s scientific program with software and computing solutions. From November 2024 till December 2025, I have also held the roles of Acting Deputy Division Director for the Scientific Computing Systems and Services Division and Department Head for the Facility Evolution Department. This department is responsible for maintaining and advancing the Computing Resources Evolution STrategy (CREST) process, which outlines a ten-year strategy for the evolution of Fermilab’s computing infrastructure based on current and future experiment needs, particularly those of DUNE and HL-LHC.

From September 2022 to July 2024, during the formation of [CSAID](https://computing.fnal.gov/organization/) from the former Scientific Computing Division, I served as the CMS Software & Computing Coordinator within the Directorate, based on my role as U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program Manager. I acted as the primary contact for all CMS software and computing efforts in the Division and contributed to budget planning, personnel management, and major strategic decisions. Concurrently, I led the Computing Resource Evolution Strategy Department, developing a comprehensive strategy for evolving Fermilab’s computing to meet current and anticipated experiment requirements.

From October 2019 to August 2022, I served in a similar role under the title Associate Head of the Scientific Computing Division for CMS.

Between October 2016 and September 2019, I was Deputy Head of the Scientific Services Quadrant, the computing infrastructure arm of the Scientific Computing Division. In this role, I oversaw development of infrastructure software components for data and workload management across Fermilab’s scientific program—including neutrino, muon, and astro-particle experiments as well as CMS.

From September 2014 to September 2016, I served as Assistant Division Head for Science Operations and Workflows within the Scientific Computing Division. I was responsible for delivering scientific computing services to all Fermilab experiments, including High Energy Physics experiments (e.g., CMS), neutrino physics (e.g., NOvA, MINERvA), intensity frontier (e.g., Mu2e, Muon g−2), and astro-particle physics (e.g., DES). As a senior management team member, I contributed to strategic planning to evolve infrastructure and operational practices. Notably, I developed a new storage strategy that streamlined operation and access to more than 30 PB of disk space dedicated to all Fermilab experiments except CMS. I was also responsible for maintaining the laboratory’s computing strategy as part of the broader Laboratory Strategy Effort and regularly reported to Fermilab leadership.

## U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program Manager

From March 2019 to December 2024, I served as the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program Manager. The mission of this program is to provide software and computing infrastructure that enables U.S. CMS researchers to maintain leadership in physics within CMS, and to supply computing resources to the [Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)](https://wlcg.web.cern.ch) as the U.S. contribution to CMS computing. The program is jointly funded by the [U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/science/hep/high-energy-physics) and the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov).

Under my leadership, the program’s annual budget increased from 15M U.S. Dollars in 2019 to nearly 20M U.S. Dollars in 2024. I led a team of over 60 FTEs, scientists and technical staff, from 20 U.S. institutions and national laboratories. I was directly involved in hiring at Fermilab and indirectly through university principal investigators for staffing new initiatives and succession planning. I provided technical direction and oversaw the funding and operations of the U.S. CMS regional facility at Fermilab and seven university facilities (Caltech, University of Florida, MIT, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Purdue University, UC San Diego, and University of Wisconsin–Madison).

The program supports personnel responsible for site administration, software and infrastructure maintenance, and strategic R\&D projects. These include the CMS software framework (CMSSW), workflow management, distributed alignment and calibration access software, and contributions to community projects such as [ROOT](https://root.cern/) and [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch).

In 2019, I began integrating formal project management into the program, introducing a regularly updated risk assessment process modeled after Fermilab’s operational risk registry. This enabled timely and accurate communication with program management and funding agencies via reports, meeting calls, biannual in-person meetings, and biennial external reviews.

## CMS Offline & Computing Coordination Area

From 2015 to 2019, the CMS collaboration appointed me Focus Area Lead for Services and Infrastructure within the CMS Software and Computing project. I coordinated global efforts on submission infrastructure, explored innovative use of commercial clouds and supercomputers, and managed the development of core infrastructure services such as data and workflow management systems.

In 2009, I was appointed Lead of the CMS Data Operations Project, a role that leveraged my expertise in physics analysis and computing. I was responsible for the timely delivery of all data and Monte Carlo samples used in CMS analyses—a critical factor in the experiment’s success.

In 2012, CMS expanded my responsibilities by appointing me Lead of the CMS Computing Operations Project. This role included oversight of more than 70 computing centers worldwide and all central computing services for CMS. I led over 60 scientists and engineers, ensuring readiness of computing facilities, monitoring central workflows and analysis, and managing global data transfers.

Following the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, the CMS collaboration awarded me the CMS Young Researcher Prize in recognition of my significant contributions to the discovery through computing. This prize is awarded annually to ten members of the collaboration.

## Workplace Culture

My approach to building and sustaining high-performing teams of professionals and scientists centers on cultivating a respectful, inclusive, and transparent workplace culture, underpinned by clear guidance and expectation management. In large organizations, structured goal-setting and performance review processes are essential for fostering motivation and alignment.

I am deeply committed to mentoring the next generation of professionals and scientists. Recognizing that recruitment starts well before the formal hiring process, I established the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program Internship Program during the early LHC years. This initiative invited junior physicists and computing engineers to spend 1–2 years at Fermilab, contributing directly to CMS’s global computing infrastructure. Many alumni of the program have continued their careers in academia and industry, including hires I made at Fermilab and other institutions, and have gone on to work at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Google, or pursued graduate studies at institutions such as Caltech, ETH Zurich, and the University of Cambridge.

More recently, I have collaborated with my teams to provide mentorship and project opportunities for students in the [U.S. CMS Summer Undergraduate Research Internship Program (PURSUE)](https://sites.google.com/upr.edu/uscms-pursue/home), helping to develop the future workforce for scientific software and computing.
