## U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program Manager

In March 2019, I was appointed the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager. The mission of the operations program is to provide for the software and computing infrastructure for U.S. CMS researchers to maintain physics leadership in CMS. The mission is also to provide computing resources to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid ([WLCG](https://wlcg.web.cern.ch)) as the U.S. contribution to the computing resource needs of the CMS collaboration. The operations program is funded by both the U.S. Department of Energy ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov/science/hep/high-energy-physics)) and the U.S. National Science Foundation ([NSF](https://www.nsf.gov)). Under my leadership, the program's annual budget increased from $15M in 2019 to almost $20M in 2024. I lead a team of more than 60 FTE of scientists and technical staff from 20 U.S. institutes and national laboratories, providing for staffing of new initiatives and succession planning through hires by university PIs, and being involved in new hires at Fermilab myself. I provide technical guidance and oversee the funding and operation of computing hardware of the U.S. CMS regional facility at Fermilab and 7 U.S. university facilities at Caltech, Florida University, MIT, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Purdue University, UC San Diego, and University of Wisconsin-Madison. The program funds effort to administer the sites, maintain the software and computing infrastructure and conduct strategic R&D projects. Amongst these projects are the CMS software framework CMSSW, the workflow software and distributed alignment and calibration access software, as well as contributions to community software projects like ROOT and Rucio. In 2019, I started introducing aspects of formal project management into the operations program and modeled a regularly updated risk assessment approach on the operational risk registry of Fermilab. This allows me to communicate timely and accurately with program management and funding agencies through regular reports and meeting calls as well as biannual in-person meetings and biennial external reviews.

## Computational, Science and Artificial Intelligence Directorate (CSAID)

In September 2019, I was appointed Associate Head of the Scientific Computing Division of Fermilab for CMS, which in the meantime transitioned into the [CMS Software & Computing Coordinator in the Computational, Science and Artificial Intelligence Directorate (CSAID)](https://computing.fnal.gov/organization/). In my role as U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager, I am the general contact for all aspects of CMS software and computing in the Directorate and involved in budgetary and personnel planning and major strategy decisions.

From October 2016 to September 2019, I was appointed Deputy Head of the Scientific Services Quadrant. This quadrant was the user facing arm of the Scientific Computing Division, and developed computing infrastructure software components for data and workload management for the whole scientific program of Fermilab, supporting neutrino, muon, and astro-particle experiments as well as CMS.

From September 2014 to September 2016, I was appointed Assistant Scientific Computing Division Head for Science Operations and Workflows in the Scientific Computing Division of Fermilab. I was responsible for the delivery of scientific computing services to all Fermilab experiments, including High Energy Physics experiments (e.g. CMS), Neutrino Physics experiments (e.g. NOvA, Minerva), Intensity Frontier experiments (e.g. mu2e, Muon g-2) and Astro Particle Physics experiments (e.g. DES). As member of the senior management team, I developed strategic plans to evolve the infrastructure and operational procedures. For example, I developed a new storage strategy that simplifies the operation and usage of the more than 30 PB of disk space at Fermilab dedicated to all experiments except CMS. I was also responsible for maintaining the computing strategy as part of the Laboratory Strategy Effort and reported to the laboratory directorate.

## CMS Offline & Computing Coordination Area

The CMS collaboration appointed me Focus Area Lead for Services and Infrastructure in the CMS Software and Computing project from 2015 to 2019. I was coordinating the efforts of the worldwide submission infrastructure, innovative new ways of using resources at commercial clouds and supercomputing centers, and the development of computing infrastructure services like data management and workflow management systems.

The CMS collaboration appointed me lead of the Data Operations Project in 2009. Using my deep involvement in physics analysis and my expertise in computing, I was responsible for the timely delivery of all data and MC samples for analysis, a significant contribution to the overall success of the experiment. In 2012, CMS extended my responsibilities and appointed me to lead all of the CMS Computing Operations Project, adding the care of over 70 computing centers distributed all over the world and all central computing services of CMS. I was supervising the contributions of more than 60 scientists and engineers to the Computing Operations Project worldwide. The team was overseeing the readiness of all the computing facilities and monitor both central workflows and analysis and the transfers of data and MC samples between the sites. After the Higgs discovery in 2012, the CMS collaboration awarded me the CMS Young Researcher Prize for enabling the Higgs Discovery with computing. This award is given to 10 collaboration members every year.

## Workplace Culture

Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Accessibility principles are the cornerstones of building and maintaining teams of highly motivated scientists and professionals. The recruitment process starts a lot earlier than forming a candidate pool for a hire. In the early years of the LHC, I created the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program Internship Program. To contribute to the operations of the software and computing infrastructure of CMS on a daily basis, junior physicists and computing engineers were invited to Fermilab to spend 1-2 years working inside the international collaboration. Many continued in careers in academia and industry, and some I was able to hire at Fermilab and other institutes to continue contributing to software and computing. Through my mentorship, members of the internship program started careers at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and Google or continued with graduate programs at Caltech, ETH Zurich or the University of Cambridge in the UK.

Recently, I am working with my teams to provide project and mentoring to students of the [U.S. CMS Summer Undergraduate Research Internship Program (PURSUE)](https://sites.google.com/upr.edu/uscms-pursue/home) to build the scientific software and computing workforce of the future.
