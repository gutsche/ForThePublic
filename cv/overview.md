I am a **leader in scientific computing** with over 15 years of experience and have developed deep expertise in scientific software and computing infrastructure. At heart, I am a particle physicist and have both conducted and enabled groundbreaking scientific discoveries in High Energy Physics (HEP). My goal is to continuously expand my horizons and apply my expertise to support an increasing number of scientific disciplines through software and computing.

High Energy Physics (HEP) relies on vast computing resources to analyze simulations and data collected by detectors. I have extensive experience in planning, developing, and operating distributed computing infrastructures that provide access to hundreds of thousands of computing cores and hundreds of petabytes of disk and tape storage. I am deeply familiar with scientific grid sites, academic and commercial cloud platforms, and the largest supercomputers in the U.S. I am also an expert in object-oriented software development, statistical data analysis methods, Monte Carlo simulation techniques, and a variety of optimization and machine learning methods. I am a member of the CMS collaboration, which operates one of the four detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Geneva, Switzerland.

Since August 2024, I have been serving as the Deputy Associate Lab Director (interim) for the Computational Science and AI Directorate (CSAID) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). I oversee strategic and tactical initiatives that support Fermilab’s scientific program through software and computing solutions. Since November 2024, I have also held the roles of Acting Deputy Division Director for the Scientific Computing Systems and Services Division and Department Head for the Facility Evolution Department. I created the Computing Resources Evolution STrategy (CREST) process, which outlines a ten-year strategy for evolving Fermilab's computing resources to meet the current and future needs of experiments such as DUNE and HL-LHC.

From March 2019 to December 2024, I served as the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program Manager, overseeing the U.S. CMS Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities, as well as software maintenance and development efforts for core software, computing infrastructure, and analysis systems. This operations program is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE). In this role, I worked closely with DOE, NSF, universities, and national laboratories to enable the analysis of LHC particle collisions in the U.S. for the CMS collaboration, and to prepare for the next phase of data-taking at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), scheduled to begin in 2030. To guide R\&D planning for HL-LHC, I co-authored a [strategic plan outlining four grand challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00772).

I am an active participant in the global community effort to prepare software and computing infrastructure for the HL-LHC, which will demand significantly greater resources than the current LHC. I co-authored the [overview white paper for the community](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982) and served as co-editor of the topical white paper on the [future of data analysis in High Energy Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03983). In recognition of my expertise, I was invited in 2020 to co-lead the [Computational Frontier](https://snowmass21.org/computational/start) of the [Particle Physics Snowmass 2021 process](https://snowmass21.org), a community-driven planning initiative to define the future vision for particle physics in the U.S. and internationally.

I am a frequent speaker at international conferences and workshops, and I serve on the editorial boards of the journal [Computing and Software for Big Science](https://www.springer.com/physics/particle+and+nuclear+physics/journal/41781?countryChanged=true) and the [European Physical Journal (EPJ C)](https://epjc.epj.org/epjc-editorial-board).

My original motivation was conducting **cutting-edge research** in the search for New Physics beyond the Standard Model, as well as precision measurements within the Standard Model. I have many years of experience analyzing high-energy collisions at various particle colliders using a wide range of techniques. I have [published numerous papers in leading journals](https://github.com/gutsche/ForThePublic/raw/master/publication_list/complete_publication_list.pdf). The CMS collaboration is a global effort with over [3,000 physicists from more than 50 countries, including over 1,000 students](https://cms.cern/index.php/collaboration/people-statistics). In my work at the LHC, I have led searches for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model using top quarks and contributed to searches for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter. One of my most notable publications is the [Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021), where my contributions in scientific computing played a significant role.
