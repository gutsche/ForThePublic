## Overview

I am a particle physicist by heart. I am conducting **leading edge research at the energy frontier** to proof the validity of the Standard Model of Particle Physics or to find New Physics Beyond the Standard Model.

I have multiple years of experience in analyzing high-energy  collisions at different particle colliders using a multitude of different techniques. I have **published many papers in leading journals** and am currently a member of the CMS collaboration. In my recent studies at the LHC, I have lead searches for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model using top quarks, and contributed to searches for Supersymmetry and Dark Matter. One of my most noticeable publications is the **Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012**.

I am a **leader in High-Energy Physics (HEP) computing** and have acquired deep knowledge and expertise in HEP software and computing. HEP requires massive amounts of computing hardware to analyze the petabytes of data recorded by the detector and simulated with Monte-Carlo techniques. I have deep experience in operating computing infrastructures providing access to several hundred-thousand computing cores and many tens of petabytes of disk space required to analyze the recorded detector signals and simulated collisions. I am an **expert in distributing and utilizing these massive amounts of resources across the world in separate data centers**. I am an expert architect and developer of the infrastructure enabling the distributed computing system. 

I held many management positions within the CMS collaboration and at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, supervising up to 60 individuals across many time zones. In September 2016, I was appointed **U.S.CMS Deputy Software and Computing Operations Program manager, overseeing a budget of $16M** to enable analysis of particle collisions in the U.S. for the 2500 physicist strong CMS collaboration.
