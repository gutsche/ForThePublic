# Research Experience

I am a particle physicist at heart, originally motivated by conducting **leading-edge research** into New Physics Beyond the Standard Model, as well as precision measurements within the Standard Model.

I have many years of experience analyzing high-energy collisions from various particle colliders using a wide range of techniques. I have [published numerous papers in leading journals](https://github.com/gutsche/ForThePublic/raw/master/publication_list/complete_publication_list.pdf) and am currently a member of the [CMS collaboration](https://cms.cern/) operating one of the four detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Geneva, Switzerland. The CMS collaboration is a global endeavor, comprising more than [3000 physicists from over 50 countries, including over 1000 students](https://cms.cern/index.php/collaboration/people-statistics).

In my past LHC research, I have led searches for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model using top quarks and contributed to investigations of Supersymmetry and Dark Matter. Among my most notable publications is the [Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.021), where my work in scientific computing played a significant role.
