# Managerial Experience

Over more than 15 years in scientific computing, I have gained extensive managerial experience across large organizational structures, including line management at CSAID, international collaborations such as CMS, and major U.S. operations programs.

Since January 2026 I have served as the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for the Computational Science and AI Directorate (CSAID) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL), a position that I held before on an interim basis since August 2024. In addition, from November 2024 till December 2025, I have held the roles of Acting Deputy Division Director for the Scientific Computing Systems and Services Division and Department Head for the Facility Evolution Department.

From March 2019 to December 2024, I was appointed U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program Manager. This program, jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), provides the software and computing infrastructure that enables U.S. CMS researchers to maintain leadership in CMS physics. Under my leadership, the program’s annual budget grew from 15M U.S. Dollars in 2019 to nearly 20M U.S. Dollars in 2024, supporting more than 60 FTEs, including scientists, technical staff, and computing hardware across Fermilab and seven U.S. university sites.

I am actively engaged in recruiting and sustaining a vibrant, high-performing workforce. I support this goal by building career pipelines through internship programs and by mentoring junior technical staff, early-career scientists, and postdoctoral researchers.
