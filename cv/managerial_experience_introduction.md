# Managerial Experience

During my career in scientific computing of more than 15 years, I have gained extensive experience managing large scientific projects like the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program, and in organizations like the international CMS collaboration at the LHC and the Computational, Science and Artificial Intelligence Directorate (CSAID) at Fermilab. 

Since 2019, I am the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager providing for the software and computing infrastructure for U.S. CMS researchers to maintain physics leadership in CMS. Under my leadership, the program's annual budget increased from $15M in 2019 to almost $20M in 2024, supporting more than 60 FTE of scientists and technical staff and computing hardware deployed at Fermilab and 7 U.S. university sites.

I am currently holding a senior management position in Fermilab CSAID and held many management positions in the CMS collaboration. 

I am active in recruiting and maintaining a diverse workforce through building pipelines through internship programs, and mentoring of junior technical staff as well as junior scientists and postdoctoral researchers.
