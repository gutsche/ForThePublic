# Managerial Experience

During my career in scientific computing of more than 15 years, I have gained extensive experience managing in large line management organizations (CSAID), large international collaborations (CMS) and large U.S. operations programs. 

Since August 2024, I am the Deputy Associate Lab Director (interim) for CSAID at Fermilab, and since November 2024, I am also the Acting Deputy Division Director for the Scientific Computing Systems and Services Division and the Department Head for the Facility Evolution Department. 

From March 2019 to December 2024, I was appointed U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager receiving funding from both the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) to provide the software and computing infrastructure for U.S. CMS researchers to maintain physics leadership in CMS. Under my leadership, the program's annual budget increased from 15M U.S. Dollars in 2019 to almost 20M U.S. Dollars in 2024, supporting more than 60 FTE of scientists and technical staff and computing hardware deployed at Fermilab and 7 U.S. university sites.

I am active in recruiting and maintaining a vibrant and efficient workforce by building career pipelines through internship programs, and mentoring of junior technical staff as well as junior scientists and postdoctoral researchers.
