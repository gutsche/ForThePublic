# Managerial Experience

I have gained extensive managerial experience managing large scientific projects like the U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program and organizations like the international CMS collaboration at the LHC and the Computational, Science and Artificial Intelligence Directorate (CSAID) at Fermilab. 

Since 2019 I am the U.S. CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager providing for the software and computing infrastructure for U.S. CMS researchers to maintain physics leadership in CMS. Under my leadership, the program's budget increased from $15M in 2019 to almost $20M in 2024, supporting more than 60 FTE of scientists and technical staff and computing hardware deployed at Fermilab and 7 U.S. university sites.

I am holding a senior management position in the Fermilab CSAI Directorate and held many management position in the CMS collaboration. 

I am active in pro-active recruiting of a diverse work force through long running Internship programs and mentoring of junior technical staff as well as junior scientists and postdoctoral researchers.
