<p>I am a particle physicist and conduct leading edge research for New Physics Beyond the Standard Model. I have multiple years of experience in analyzing particle collisions. I am member of the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and am looking for evidence of Dark Matter and Supersymmetry. One of my most noticeable publications is the “Observation of the Higgs Boson in 2012”.</p>
<p>I am a leader in scientific computing. I am an expert in object oriented software development; statistical data analysis methods, optimization and machine learning techniques; and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. I have extensive experience in planningand and operating distributed computing infrastructures (scale: 100,000 cores, 100 PB disk). I am intimately familiar with grid sites, commercial clouds and U.S. supercomputers. Recently I was part of a worldwide community planning process for the software and computing infrastructure of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC, 2026). The upgraded machine and detectors will require 20 times as much resources as today. I contributed to the overview white paper of the community and was editor of the white paper about the future of data analysis. My interest is to use idustry technologies for petabyte scale analysis. I started the CMS Big Data Project. One component is the collaboration with Intel on scaling of analysis facilities to Petabytes.</p>
<p>I was appointed Deputy U.S.CMS Software and Computing Operations Program manager in 2016, overseeing a budget of $16M to enable analysis of LHC particle collisions in the U.S. for the 2500 physicist strong CMS collaboration.</p>
